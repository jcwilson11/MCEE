# How to import and export templates
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSjXDPzFrQ0``` - This video shows how to import and export templates in the game. It is recorded on a mac, but the steps are the same for windows. I am not sure if this can be done on mobile. It may require additional apps, and will not be covered in this video.

Since I have already prepared the **.mctemplate file**, you should be able to import it directly into your game without having to import the individual files. 

If that does not work, **generate two unique UUIDs**, open the **maniffest.json** file, and **replace the UUIDs with the new ones.** Then, zip the **ALL** files and **change the extension to .mctemplate.** You can then **import the .mctemplate file into your game.**
