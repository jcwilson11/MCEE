# How to import and export worlds
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSjXDPzFrQ0``` - This video shows how to import and export worlds in the game. It is recorded on a pc, but the steps are the same

Since I have already prepared the **.mcworld file**, you should be able to import it directly into your game without having to import the individual files.
